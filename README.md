# Literal-Console-Games-Collection
The Literal Console Games Collection (LCGC) is a collection of games that you can play in the console, as in the cmd.exe command interpreter. So, technically speaking, this is a console game. Doesn't run on actual consoles though. This time I'm talking about game consoles. Not to be confused with console games. Alright, this is getting a bit messy, let's just move on.

## How to play
Just download the folder, pop them into your IDE of choice and make it run a C# program. I recommend to open it via the .sln file in Visual Studio, because I don't know any other IDE or how else you can open it. Other than that I literally don't know how else you can play this. I'm not exactly an expert programmer. I'm not even an average programmer, I'm just a rookie. So, uhh... yeah. Do that.

### Main Menu
Once the program is running you should see a short little animation followed by a screen similar to the one below. (Assuming I actually finished it.)

This is where you can type out one of the numbers to pick a game and then press enter. After that just follow the instructions for whichever game you picked!

### Exit
Exits the program. That's it.
Also has a neat little animation. (Assuming I actually finished it.)

### Russian Roulette
You pick a number from 1-6 and then the game tells you if you win or lose. Not much fun to be had here, but it was easy to program, so I decided to make it as a little exercise.

## To be continued
More stuff will be added in the future. Or in a sequel. Not sure yet. I'm kinda not very good at updating things. Generally I prefer just starting from scratch. Should definitely stop doing that.
