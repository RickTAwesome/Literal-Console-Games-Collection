# Literal-Console-Games-Collection
The Literal Console Games Collection (LCGC) is a collection of games that you can play in the console, as in the cmd.exe command interpreter. So, technically speaking, this is a console game. Doesn't run on actual consoles though. This time I'm talking about game consoles. Not to be confused with console games. Alright, this is getting a bit messy, let's just move on.

## How to play
Just download the file, pop them into your IDE of choice and make it run a C# program. Other than that I literally don't know how else you can play this. I'm not exactly an expert programmer. I'm not even an average programmer, I'm just a rookie. So, uhh... yeah. Do that.
